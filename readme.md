# Homepage

Simple homepage showcasing items on my github profile. Built with Bootstrap Sass. Assets compiled with Gulp.js.

## Installation
Running `npm install` will install all necessary node_modules. Gulp must be install globally, which can be done with `npm install gulp -g`. With gulp installed, simply run `gulp` from the root directory and the compiled site will be served to `localhost:8080`.
